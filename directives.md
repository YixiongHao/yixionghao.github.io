This folder contains a github pages personal website for Yixiong Hao.  This markdown is for Yixiong to take notes and store high level directives!  Claude should use CLAUDE.md for notes and implementation details.

Content/function:
- Main page
  - Introductory text/paragraphs (use placeholder text)
  - Email place holder right below my name
  - Links below my name to socials and various platforms, resume, calendar, etc
- \writing
  - Contains a bunch of links to subpages that contain the writing/blog
- \projects
  - Needs a visually appealing and consistent layout
  - Each item needs to support text, hyperlinks, and image/video media 
- 

Style/aesthetics:
- Simplistic, sophisticated, visually appealing, easy to read max out on 'taste', whatever that means.  
- All hyperlinks should have underline when hovered.
- Make hyperlinks have a different colored font to stand out.
- Use your best judgement for placement and alignment of text, headers, etc with respect to above directives.  This needs to be consistent across pages.

Tech stack:
- Keep simple/minimal with just html/css.  If you think using some library/module is better, let me know why!


Claude notes: (feel free to edit this section to add notes/elaborations/changes, only include items the human should know of to keep track of teh tech stack and styles of this website, such as font families/color palettes used, etc)
